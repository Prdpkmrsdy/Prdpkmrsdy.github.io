        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Worked on an L2 (2-wheeler) EV powertrain skateboard program with responsibility for electrical
          systems integration, wiring harness development (NPD), homologation readiness, and supplier
          ecosystem development across the prototype to pre-production phase.

      <!-- 1) Vehicle Prototype -->
      <div class="card">

        <h3>Vehicle Prototype &amp; Powertrain Integration</h3>
        <p>
          This image shows the L2 electric two-wheeler prototype developed at kWh Motors.
          I worked as part of the core powertrain and electrification team, supporting electrical
          system integration during the prototype to pre-production phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responsibilities included electrical architecture alignment, subsystem compatibility checks,
          and integration readiness across motor, controller, battery pack, and vehicle peripherals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 2) Wiring Harness -->
      <div class="card">
        <img src="wiring Harness.JPG" alt="EV wiring harness development and NPD" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>Wiring Harness Development &amp; Cost Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          Shown here is a wiring harness developed as part of the electrical new product development (NPD)
          for the L2 EV platform. I owned the harness architecture, connector selection, and routing strategy
          with a focus on manufacturability, reliability, and cost optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through connector rationalization and design simplification, I reduced the overall connector count
          and achieved a per-vehicle cost saving of approximately USD 27 while meeting functional and safety
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          Harness design reviewed under DFMEA (SAE J1739) and aligned with homologation and serviceability considerations.

      <!-- 3) Wheel Dyno -->
      <div class="card">
        <img src="2W_wheel_dyno.JPG" alt="2-wheeler wheel dyno validation setup" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>2-Wheeler Wheel Dyno Testing &amp; Validation</h3>
        <p>
          This image captures a 2-wheeler wheel dyno setup used for functional validation and performance
          evaluation of the electric powertrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I supported electrical bring-up, instrumentation readiness, and validation activities to verify
          system behavior prior to vehicle-level testing and homologation workflows.
